Hiii my name is Avantika, and I created this website called winter solstice. It is a very chill website that embodies the true beauties of the winter time even when the days are darker. I incorperated a little 
Javascript in the background for some animations, but other than that, it is just lots of CSS and basic HTMl. I enjoyed making this website a lot, and hope you learn the joys of winter while you look at it!!

Much love - Avantika Satheesh
